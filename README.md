TuxRacer-SDL2
=============

Port of Tux Racer to SDL 2.0, allowing for better cross-platform deployment. Other enhancements include a custom settings menu and full joystick support.

Initial code was taken from the Tux-Racer-4-iOS project (https://github.com/FeeJai/Tux-Racer-4-iOS) but has been heavily modified to build in Visual Studio 2008+2010 and run on Windows and Android.
